!!! install.sh is broken for sure. It needs work. Restructuring. Not gonna bother for now !!!  

#### Todo:
- Add an alias.zsh to zsh folder for ~/oh-my-zsh/custom/ because I always end up creating that and putting same stuff in it...



`install.sh` backs up and creates symlinks for:

- ~/.vimrc
- ~/.zshrc
- ~/.Xresources
- ~/.i3status.conf
- ~/.config/i3/config

Also installs zsh and oh my zsh if not installed. 


Uninstall deletes symlinks and puts everything back.
