## Do not use this install script...its broken for the moment!
`install.sh` backs up and creates symlinks for:

- ~/.vimrc
- ~/.zshrc
- ~/.Xresources
- ~/.i3status.conf
- ~/.config/i3/config

Also installs zsh and oh my zsh if not installed. 

Uninstall deletes symlinks and puts everything back.

## To-do:
- Make a version for i3/wm? or put it in the script which you are using? 
- Also put in the script a way to get username and update the rc.lua automatically?
